            <p>Hi. Thank you for taking the time to stop by and view my portfolio. I'd like to share a 
                little more about myself. I'm in the process of learning Web Development through KU's Coding
                Bootcamp. Before starting down this path I took some continuing education courses at Johnson County 
               Community College.</p>
            <p>At the moment I am working at Garmin using my B.S. in Geography as an 
                Aviation Cartographer. There we input and manage data for thousands of airports and charts that is viewable
                by pilots digitally as they fly.</p>
            <p>I live in Overland Park, KS with my husband and two pups. We enjoy movies and are boardgame geeks.</p>
